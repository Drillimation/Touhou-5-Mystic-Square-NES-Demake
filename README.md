# Touhou-5-Mystic-Square-NES-Demake
An NES-style adaptation of the PC-98 game.

**NOTE:** If you want to download and play the demake, please click [here](https://drillimation.itch.io/touhou-5-mystic-square) to access its itch.io page.

***Touhou 5: Mystic Square*** was originally released for the PC-98 by Team Shanghai Alice in 1998. Drillimation Systems, the developer best known for the *Chuhou Joutai* series, ported the game to PC in the style of an NES game using the GameMaker engine in 2022. It is the fifth game in the highly popular Touhou Project series and the final PC-98 game.

Reimu Hakurei, Marisa Kirisame, and Mima return as playable characters. A new character, Yuuka Kazami from the previous game, also joins. The game takes place after the events of *Lotus Land Story*. A flood of demons from Makai (called the Aetherworld in this demake) comes to earth, leading to the playable characters trying to find their source. *Mystic Square* also marked the debut of Alice Margatroid, who would later return as a boss in *Touhou 7: Perfect Cherry Blossom*.

*Mystic Square* would create the framework for the present-day *Touhou Project* games, but wasn't known to many players until the NES demake port released. Before that, *Touhou 6: The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil* is the game that formally introduced most players to the *Touhou Project* franchise. As a result of the demake, the game is now playable on modern machines without the need to configure an emulator.

## About this repository
In 2023, Drillimation released the source code for the game. This repository is intended for GameMaker users wanting to develop their own retro style *Touhou Project* fangame or danmaku shooter, or to improve upon its flaws.

This source code is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial license (CC-BY-NC). Because the game itself is based on the second actual *Touhou Project* game, we have chosen to release it under that license.
